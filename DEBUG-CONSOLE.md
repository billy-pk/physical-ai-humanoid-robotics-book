# How to Check Console Logs

## Quick Steps

1. **Open DevTools**: Press `F12` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac)
2. **Click "Console" tab** at the top of DevTools
3. **Try signing up** - fill form and click "Sign Up"
4. **Look for logs** - you should see messages like:
   - `SignUp result: ...`
   - `SignUp successful, calling onSuccess`
   - `handleSignupSuccess called, moving to questionnaire`
   - `SignUpFlow step changed to: questionnaire`

## What to Share

Copy and paste any console messages you see, especially:
- Any **red error messages**
- The `SignUp result:` log
- Any warnings (yellow text)

## Screenshot Alternative

If you prefer, you can take a screenshot of the console and share it.
