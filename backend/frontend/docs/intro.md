# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the core concepts of Physical AI.
- Identify key characteristics and applications of humanoid robotics.
- Differentiate between traditional AI and Physical AI.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through a physical body. Unlike traditional AI, which often operates purely in digital or simulated environments, Physical AI embodies intelligence in robots, drones, and other cyber-physical systems.

### Key Characteristics:

1.  **Embodiment**: The AI possesses a physical form, allowing it to move, sense, and manipulate objects in the environment.
2.  **Interaction**: It actively engages with its surroundings, gathering sensory data and performing actions that have real-world consequences.
3.  **Real-world Learning**: Physical AI often learns from direct experience and interaction with the physical environment, adapting its behavior based on sensory feedback and trial-and-error.

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is a specialized field within Physical AI focusing on designing and building robots that resemble and mimic human actions. These robots are often designed to operate in human-centric environments and perform tasks traditionally done by humans.

### Examples of Humanoid Robots:

-   **Atlas (Boston Dynamics)**: Known for its advanced mobility, balance, and ability to perform complex dynamic movements like parkour.
-   **Sophia (Hanson Robotics)**: A social humanoid robot capable of realistic facial expressions and engaging in conversations.
-   **ASIMO (Honda)**: One of the earliest prominent humanoid robots, designed for human interaction and mobility.
